# this will mount a crypt directory, look in a couple of files for a pattern
# if it finds a single match, it'll put a password in the x11 selection and print other login information in clear.
# if there are multiple matches, those login information is shown instead, but the passwords are ignored.

# password file format:
# <password> <login-name-or-url> notes

# i know, this isn't very secure, but it works for all password inputs and is simple to do.
# it at least gives a commandline interfaces for requesting login data from some secure storage.
